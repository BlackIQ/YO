# YO Lang Documentation

## Introduction
**YOLang** is a compiled and open source language based on .NET Core and .NET Framework.

The YO's syntax is similar to languages such as Rust, Go, and C; and YOlang is also a High-Level language, but its design seeks to retain some of the properties of low-level languages.
